For my master's, I examined the extent to which emotion dysregulation was transmitted across generations, from mother to newborn. I examined relations between prenatal maternal emotion dysregulation and newborn neurobehavior indirectly through prenatal maternal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and coded stress behavior during the Trier Social Stress Test.

The following publications emerged from my master's thesis:
- Vlisides-Henry, R. D. (2019). Like mother like daughter (or son): Prenatal exposure to maternal stress
and emotion dysregulation as predictors of newborn neurobehavior (Publication No. 22584991)
[Master's thesis, University of Utah]. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing.
- Vlisides-Henry, R. D., Deboeck, P. R., Grill-Velasquez, W., Mackey, S., Ramadurai, D. K. A., Urry, J.
O., Neff, D., Terrell, S., Gao, M., Thomas, L., Conradt, E., & Crowell, S. E. (2021). Behavioral and
physiological stress responses: Within-person concordance during pregnancy.
