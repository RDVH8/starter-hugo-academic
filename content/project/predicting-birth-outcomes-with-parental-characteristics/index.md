Numerous aspects of prenantal maternal health are related to newborn outcomes. As part of my involvement in various studies, I have shed new light on these relations. Throughout my time in graduate school, I have worked on numerous projects to predict newborn birth outcomes with various parental characteristics and better understand parental risk more broadly. Much of my work on this project was related to my master's thesis, but I have also extended beyond my thesis project to better understand infant well-being several years into life.

This project led to several publications and presentations, including:

Machine learning reveals that prior pregnancy experiences, race/ethnicity, and emotion dysregulation predict newborn health outcomes [Flash talk paper presentation].

I also have a paper under review on the use of machine learning techniques to predict newborn birth weight and head circumference with numeroul prenatal maternal health and demographic characteristics.
