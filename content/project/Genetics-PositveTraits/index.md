As an undergraduate research assistant and honors thesis student, I collaborated with psychology and neuroscience faculty and helped conduct a study on the relations between the OXTR receptor gene (rs53576), trait gratitude, and responses to a series of reappraisal prompts. I also conducted an honors thesis on the psychophysiological associations of trait grit.

This project led to several publications and presentations, including:
