I am a Psychology PhD student (Doctoral Candidate) working with Dr. Sheila Crowell and Dr. Elisabeth Conradt at the University of Utah. I am planning to defend my dissertation in 2022.

My research focuses on the lifespan impact of emotion dysregulation on risk for psychopathology. As a methodologist, I am especially interested in the use of innovative and rigorous approaches to measuring emotion dysregulation and stress across lifespan transitions. The perinatal period has been my primary focus during graduate school.
