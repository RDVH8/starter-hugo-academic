I am a Psychology PhD student (Doctoral Candidate) working with Dr. Sheila Crowell and Dr. Elisabeth Conradt at the University of Utah. I am planning to defend my dissertation in 2022.

My research focuses on the lifespan impact of emotion dysregulation on risk for psychopathology. As a methodologist, I am especially interested in the use of innovative and rigorous approaches to measuring emotion dysregulation and stress across lifespan transitions. The perinatal period has been my primary focus during graduate school.

After graduating, I plan to pursue a career as a statistical analyst/statistician outside of academia. I have developed a number of advanced skills in quantitative research methods, including longitudinal data analysis, hierarchical linear and nonlinear models, factor analysis, dynamic structural equation modeling, power analysis, and rigorous approaches missing data.
