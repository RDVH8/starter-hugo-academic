My research focuses on the lifespan impact of emotion dysregulation on risk for psychopathology. As a methodologist, I am especially interested in the use of innovative and rigorous approaches to measuring emotion dysregulation and stress across lifespan transitions. The perinatal period has been my primary focus during graduate school.
