abstract: abstract: Ethical and consensual digital phenotyping through smartphone activity
  (i. e., passive behavior monitoring) permits measurement of temporal risk
  trajectories unlike ever before. This data collection modality may be
  particularly well-suited for capturing emotion dysregulation, a
  transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, across lifespan transitions.
  Adolescence, emerging adulthood, and perinatal transitions are particularly
  sensitive developmental periods, often marked by increased distress. These
  participant groups are typically assessed with laboratory-based methods that
  can be costly and burdensome. Passive monitoring presents a relatively
  cost-effective and unobtrusive way to gather rich and objective information
  about emotion dysregulation and risk behaviors. We first discuss key
  theoretically-driven concepts pertaining to emotion dysregulation and passive
  monitoring. We then identify variables that can be measured passively and hold
  promise for better understanding emotion dysregulation. For example, two
  strong markers of emotion dysregulation are sleep disturbance and problematic
  use of Internet/social media (i.e., use that prompts negative
  emotions/outcomes). Variables related to mobility are also potentially useful
  markers, though these variables should be tailored to fit unique features of
  each developmental stage. Finally, we offer our perspective on candidate
  digital variables that may prove useful for each developmental transition.
  Smartphone-based passive monitoring is a rigorous method that can elucidate
  psychopathology risk across human development. Nonetheless, its use requires
  researchers to weigh unique ethical considerations, examine relevant theory,
  and consider developmentally-specific lifespan features that may affect
  implementation.
